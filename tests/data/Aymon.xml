As the philosopher , in the fyrst booke of hys metaphysyque , sayth , *that* every man / naturally desireth to know / and to con newe thynges : And therfore have the Clerkes / ＆ people / of great vnderstandynge desyred and concite to lerned sciences , and to know vertues of thinges . Some by Phylosophy , other by Poetrye , and other by Historyes / and cronyikes / of thynges passed . And vpo*n* these three they have greatly laboured / in suche *that* thanked be God , by theyr good dylygence / and laboures , they have had greate knowledge by innumerable volumes of bookes , whiche have be made / and compyled by great studye and payne / vnto thys day .

And besechynge his said noble good grace / to pardon me of y^e^ rude , and this simple worke .

And ye shall see in this fyrst chapytre howe , that after kynge Charlemagne / was come agayne / from the partyes of Lombardy , where he had had great and merveyllouse battaylles / agenste the sarasyns , he helde vpon whitsondaye , open courte / at Parys , where was a fayre felawshyp of Prynces / and Barons , as ye shall heare after alonge . And in the same chapitre / ye shall also see howe , the same daye / the duke Aymon of Ardeyne / broughte to the courte hys foure sonnes , that is to wit , Reynawde , Alarde , Guichard , and Richarde , and howe kynge Charlemagne / made theym knyghtes wyth his owne handes ; also howe the duke Benes of Aigremounce / slewe Lohier , the eldest sonne of kyng Charlemain ( the duke benes was vncle to the foure so*n*nes of Aymon ) ; and after , how the duke Benes of aygremount / was slaine coming to Paris , by the commaundemente of kinge Charlemagne , after that he had appointed , for the death of his sonne .

The seconde Chapyter sheweth howe Gryllon of haultefelle , and Guenes , after that they had slayne the duke Benes of Aygremount , retourned to Parys , and recounted to kynge Charlemagne / the mortall treason that they had put to execucyon ; wherof the kynge was ryghte glad ; and syn after he was ryghte sorye for it . For after that , the two bretherne of the duke Benes / made great warre agenst him , and so did Gerarde of Roussillon , and Dron , and Mawgys , the sonne of the duke Benes ; and after , they made peace and accorded togyther . But the kinge Charlemain accorded not with the foure sonnes of Aymon , nor to<newpage pageno="6"/> their cosin Mawgys .<comment comtext="edition has here a black leaf symbol to indicate a gap"/> Item howe Reynawde slew the nevew of king Charlemagne with a chesse boorde , as they plaied togyther at the chesse , wherof the warre began , the whiche was so mortall / and lasted so longe , that it bare a great dommage to the realme of Fraunce . The thirde chapitre speaketh , how after that kynge Charlemagne hadde made all his barons to forsake the foure sonnes of aymon / He went and besyeged them at mou*n*tenforde , where he was dyscomfyted two tymes ; but the castelle of Mou*n*tenforde was taken , after that , by tr*e*ason . And after , howe Reynawde and his bretherne avenged theim of the traytoures that betrayed theym , And after saved theym selfe wythin the forest of Ardeyne , Where theyr father found the*m* / as he went from the syege / to warde his londe of Dordon . And howe , for to keep his othe that he had made to kynge Charlemagne / He dyd assayle hys sonnes ; so that , of fyve hundred menne that they were , there abod on live with his sonnes but xvii. persones . But Reynawd and his brethern / had none evil , but slew many of their fathers men . The fourth chapytre sheweth how , after that the olde Aimon / had discomfyted his chyldren , they went and dwelled in the depest of the forest of Ardeyne , and abode there / tyll that they were al counterfayte blacke / and roughe / as wilde beastes , for the greate hungre that they had suffred ; and after , they went to Dordon / for to see their father , that made them good chere , and feasted them greately . And gave them of hauoyre so muche / that they myghte well make war with agenst the king ; and howe Mawgis their cosyn arryved , whan that they should have departed , whiche went with theym in to the realme of Gascoygne / with fyve hundred knightes . And whan theyr mother sawe them departe , she was for it full sorye .<newpage pageno="7"/> The fyfthe chaptre sheweth how , after that Reynawde / and hys brethern , with theyr cosyn mawgys , were departed from theyr mother / for to seeke their adventure / they went so longe tyll they came to the realme of Gascoygne . And howe / goynge thitherwarde , they made manye evylles in Fraunce . And howe the kynge of Gascoygn , wha*n* they were come there / dyd receive them in his servise ryghte sweetly , in bourdeux vpon Gyrond , by cause / that than this king of Gascoigne , that was called Yon , had warre agenst a kyng sarasin / that was entred into Gascoyne , that had to name Portus , that helde Tholouse and all the londe aboute . The VI chapter speaketh how Reinawde / and his bretherne / dystressed bourgous , a sarasyn that had distroyed the realme of Gascoign , and had chased the kinge yon / to bordeux vpon Gyronde , that durste not departe from thence , for feare of the sarasyns . And howe kyng Yon gave his sister Clare / vnto Reinawde / to be hys wyfe , for the greate servyse / that he hadde doon to hym . And dyd doo make for hym the castell of Mountawban . The seventh chapitre speaketh how Charlemagne , for a voyage that he made to saint Iames in Galyce , he knewe in his comynge agayne / howe Reynawde and his bretherne , that were his mortalle enmies , were in Gascoygne / with in a stronge castel , called Mountawban . And how he sente worde to kinge Yon , that he shoulde delyver to hym Reynawde and hys bretherne . And yf he refused to doo thys , he shoulde come and besyege hym in hys londe / afore X or XII moneths were passed ; Wherof ki*n*g Yon answered / that he shoulde not doo it . And howe , after that kynge Charlemagne / was retourned to Parys , Rowlande , his neuewes , arryved<newpage pageno="8"/> at Parys , whiche the kyng made knyght . And after sente him for to reyse a siege afore Coloyne / that a sarasyn had besyeged / that was called Estorfawde , the which was overcome by Rowla*n*d . And howe Reynawde wan the crowne of Charlemagne / for his well rennynge / vpon hys baye horse at Parys . The .viii. chapitre speaketh / how Charlemagne went into Gascoygne / with his host , and besieged Reynawd and his bretherne / within Mountawban ; and howe Reynawde wan the fyrst batail of the king , which Rowlande conduyted , with Olyver and the bishop Turpin ; wherof Charlemayne was so sore wrothe , that he wende to have wexed mad for it / of the great shame that he had of it . The .ix. chapitre sheweth howe Reynawde / and his bretherne / were betrayed , and solde to king Charlemagne by kinge Yon , that sent theym in to the playne of Walcoloures / alƚ vnarmed , but onelye of theyr swerdes , ryding vpon mulettes / clothed with mantelles of scarlate / furred with ermynes . From the whyche walle / they escaped worthylye , by the wyll of our lorde . But they were sore wounded . Of Charlemaines partye , abode there deade , Toulques of Moxillon , and many other barons , for whome the kynge was ryghte sorye . The .x. chapitre speaketh howe , after that Goodard , the secretarye of kynge yon , had be-wrayed all the treason to Mawgys / that the kynge Yon had doone to hys cosyns , whiche he knewe well , For he had seene kynge Charlemagnes lettres , and had wrytten answere thervpon from kinge Yon , Mawgys brought to reynawde and hys / suche a succourses , that by his wyt / they were kepte from death .<newpage pageno="9"/> The .xi chapitre speaketh howe , by the succours that Mawgis broughte to reynawde / and to his bretherne / into the playne of Walcoloures , they discomfited kyng charlemagnes folke ; wherof Ogier had manye reproches of rowlande / for some goodnes / and favoure / that he had shewed to reynawde / and his bretherne / at roche mountbron , and was therfore called traitoure , wherof a great inconvenience came therof afterwarde / afore king Charlemagne . The xii chapitre sheweth howe , that after reynawde / and hys brethern / were whole of their wou*n*des that they had had in the playnes of Walcoloures , they retourned to Mountawban . But whan kyng Yon / knewe of theyr comynge agayn , he fledde awaye , and made hymselfe to be shorne a monke in a monastery / that was within the woode of the serpente ; where rowlande and Ogyer the Dane / founde him , and wold have made him be hanged for the treason / that he had doone to reynawde / and to his brethern , yf Reynawde had not succoured hym . The xiii. chapitre sheweth how , that after Reynawde had succoured kyng yon , was the same houre a merveyllouse battaylle / betweene / Reynawde and the frenshemen . For Rowlande was there sore beten , and many other , wherof Ogyer was glad , by cause that Rowland had called hym traytoure . And also he knewe / that the foure sonnes of Aymon / were not for to be so lyghtelye overcomen , as men had sayde afore . And for this cause / there had been a sore medle betweene Rowland and Ogyer ,<footnote fntext="mais les autres baros les departirent, F. orig. 1480."/> yf it had not be the other barons that departed them ; and in this recountre Rycharde , the brother of Reynawde , abode for prisoner of Rowlande . The .xiiii. chapitre sheweth how , after that Reynawde , Alarde , and Guycharde / were gone to warde<newpage pageno="10"/> Mountawban / after the battayle , and that they had made full greate sorowe for Rychard / theyr brother , which was in kinge Charlemagnes handes , The sayd Rychard / was delyvered by mawgys greate wysedome . The .xv. chapitre speaketh how , after that Reynawde and hys brethern / and Mawgys / had discomfyted Charlemagne , they came and overthrewe downe his pavilyon , and bare a waye with theym the Egle of golde / that was there vpon the pavilion ; wherof kynge Charlemagne was sore an angred , in so muche that he wolde yeelde vp his crowne vnto his barons , sayinge / that he wolde be no more kynge , for they had fayled hym and habandonned , for the foure sonnes of Aymon ; and sayde to the*m* / that they should crown Reinawd , that he might be theyr king , for they loved him much more than they dyd hym . Than Olyver sayde to kinge Charlemagne , that he should take againe the croun , and that he shoulde brynge to him Mawgys , that he had taken / whan he was aboute to pylle the pavyllyon , for he abode alone . whan kynge Charlemagne hearde the same , he tooke agayne his crowne , and was ryghte glad of the prise of mawgis . The .xvi. chapitre speaketh how the kynge Charlemagne / wolde doo hange Mawgys , Incontynente that Olyver had take hym to him . But by the meane of the Douseperes of Fraunce , that at the requeste of Mawgys , pledgyd hym for one nyght onelye . He made so muche that he escaped , to the honoure / and acquytaunce / of hys sureties / and of hym , and bare a waye with hym to Mountawban / the crowne and the swerde / of kynge Charlemagne / the same nyghte ; wherof kynge Charlemagne was full sory . And therfore he sende worde to Reynawde / that he shoulde sende to hym agayne his crowne / and his swerde , and<newpage pageno="11"/> all that Mawgys had borne awaye with hym , and he shoulde grant hym his truce for two yeres . To the which thing Reynawde accorded hym ; wherof happed to hym , after that , many great evylles . The .xvii. Chapytre sheweth how Reynawde faught with Rowland / which he overcame / by the wyl of god , And brought hym to mou*n*tawban , wherof kyng Charlemagne was greatly wrothe . And also sheweth how Mawgys / brought king Charlemayne / into the castel of Mountawban / vpon bayarde all a slepe . And after tooke hym to Reinawd within his bed . And after wente and arrayed hym selfe / in maner of an Hermyte / poorely clothed . And lefte all his kinnesmen / and freendes , by cause that he wolde not let the peace of Reynawde / toward the kynge Charlemagne / for the war had lasted to longe . The .xviii. chapytre sheweth how , after that Mawgys had taken Charlemagne / in to the handes of Reinawde his good cosin , he went without leave in to a woode / nyghe the ryver of Dordon , in to a hermitage , where he dyd dwelle as an Hermyte , lyvinge poorely , for to save his soule . The .xix. chapitre sheweth howe the barons of Fraunce that were at Mountawban / made great sorowe by cause that they myghte not awake the kynge Charlemagne / that Mawgys by his crafte / had made to slepe , and broughte vnto Mountawban . But whan the houre of the enchauntemente of Mawgys / was passed , kyng Charlemagne awaked . And whan he saw himselfe in Mountawban / he sware that he shoulde never make peace wyth Reynawde / as longe as that he were prysoner . And so Reynawde dyd sende hym againe vpon his horse bayard , free and quite . Wherof he repented him sore afterwarde ; for soone after this kyng<newpage pageno="12"/> Charlemagne made Mountawban to be besyeged of so nyghe / that he famyshed Reynawd / and his bretherne , his wife , his children , and all the people / so that they dyed for hungre and thirst / the most parte . The .xx. chapitre speaketh howe / after that Charlemaine had besyeged Mountawban of so nyghe / that he dyd famysh all them that were wythin , knewe howe Reynawde was gone / and had habandonned Mountawban , and was gone his waye , he and his bretherne , hys wyfe and hys chylderne , by vnder the erthe , and were gone to Ardeyne , where kynge Charlemagne went and besyeged the*m* agayne . But afore that<footnote fntext="Dordonne, F. orig. a. vi. back."/> he dyd set his syege / Reynawde and hys bretherne yssued oute agenst hym . Whereby manye one loste their lyfe / of the one partie and of the other . And the duke Richarde of Normandye was taken there / which was one of the Douse peres of Fraunce / and a ryghte noble and a worthy knyght , preu and hardy ; wherfore kynge Charlemaine was ryghte sorye . The .xxi. chapitre sheweth how Mawgys , beynge in his hermytage / came in his mynde a vysion , that he hadde by nyghte in his slepe , for to goe see Reynawde and his bretherne . Than in the mornynge he tooke hys waye / and founde two marchauntes / the which had been<footnote fntext="had been: 'he had be,' in original."/> robbed by seven theeves in a wood . Of the whiche seven theeves / Mawgys slewe five of theym with his palster , and tooke again to the marchauntes theyr marchaundyses / and all theyr havoyre . And than he went forth his waye toward Mountawban / for to see his cosyns and hys brethern . The .xxii. Chapiter sheweth , how Reynawde wolde have doon hange Richard / the duke of Normandye ,<newpage pageno="13"/> by cause he myghte not have peace with the kinge Charlemagne . And howe / whan the Douse peeres of Fraunce knewe this , they came to kyng Charlemagne , and prayed hym to make peace with Reynawde / for to have againe theyr felawe / the duke Rycharde of Normandye ; to the whiche thynge , kynge Charlemagne answered , that he should not doo it ; wherof they were so sore an angred that they left him ; but kynge Charlemaine dyd sende after theym / and sent theym worde that they shoulde returne agayne to hym , and that he shoulde make peace with Reynawde vnder this condicyon / that Reinawd should goe beyonde the sea , beggynge his breade . The .xxiii. Chapytre sheweth howe , after that Reynawde was departed from Ardeyne / for to make hys vyage beyonde the sea , poorely clothed as a pylgrym , seekynge hys breade for goddes sake / Rycharde of Normandye tooke Bayarde , and brought with him Alard , Guychard , and Rycharde , bretherne to Reynawde / and presented theym to Charlemagne , the whiche he receyved ryghte honourablye by good love , and after brake his syege , and departed for to goe to Parys . But whan he was in the citye of Lyege , vpon the brydge over the ryver Mewsethe / made Bayard to be cast into the water with a mille stone at the necke of hym ; but bayarde the horse escaped , and is yet a lyve in the forest of Ardeyne / as men sayen . The .xxiii. Chapytre sheweth howe , that after Reynawde was departed from Ardeyne , from hys bretherne , from his wife / and fro hys chyldrene , for to goe beyonde the sea for to accomplyshe hys voyage to the holy grave , he found in Consta*n*tynople / hys cosyn Mawgis , and went both togither vnto afore Iherusalem , that a kynge sarasyn / whiche was admyral of percie ,<newpage pageno="14"/> had taken by treason . but Reynawde and Mawgys dyd so muche wyth the folke of the lond , that the cytye was take agayne of the christen . The .xxv. Chapytre sheweth how , that after Reynawde was come agayne from the holy londe , where he had doone merveyles , he sent Aimoner / and Yonnet , hys two sonnes / to kynge Charlemaine muche honourably , for to be made knightes of hys hande . For he taughte theym well in armes , in all good maners , and tooke to theym fyve hundred good men / well horsed , for to conduyte them towarde the kyng at Parys . The .xxvi. Chapytre sheweth how , after that kyng Charlemagne had muche swetely receyved the chylden of Reynawde / and made theym knightes , they fought wyth ye sonnes of Toulques of Moxyllon / and discomfited theym in the feeld at Parys , whyche is called the ylle of our lady . Bicause that they had charged theyr father of treason , bycause he had slaine theyr father / Toulques of Moxyllon , in the playnes of Walcolours . The .xxvii. chapitre conteineth how , *tha*t after Reynawde was gone from Mountawban in maner of a pilgrime / never to have returned agayne , after that he had dealed his goodes to his children , his brethern and his sonne Aymanet / made great sorow whan they wyst that he was gone wythout theyr knowledge , all barefote , with a palster in his hande . The .xxviii. chapitre sheweth how , after that Reynawde was departed fro Mountawba*n* for to save his soule / he went to Coleine vpon the Rine , and founde that men builded the churche of saynt Peter . And there came to hym a wyll / and a devocyon / for to serve<newpage pageno="15"/> the masons / that wrought there , for the love that he had to our lorde . But at the laste , the other labourers had so great envye at hym / of that he was more loved than they were of all the maysters , for the good service that he dyd / that they slew hym ; and after , they put hym in a sacke ＆ caste hym into the water of the Ryne ; but by the wil of our lord , his corps appered above ye watir , makyng so many fayre myracles , healyng of sykenesses / so that he was named a saynte the daye of hys buryenge . ¶ Here finyssheth the table , and consequentely followeth the book heere after . CHAPTER I. Howe duke Aimon of Ardein brought to the courte his foure sonnes , that is to wit , Reynawde , Alarde , Guichard , and Richarde , and howe kynge Charlemagne / made theym knyghtes wyth his owne handes ; also howe the duke Benes of Aigremounte slewe Lohier , the eldest sonne of kynge Charlemain . the duke benes was uncle / to the foure so*n*nes of Aimon ; and after , how the duke Benes of aygremount was slaine coming to Paris , by the commaundemente of kinge Charlemagn / after that he had appointed , for the death of his sonne . And also in this first chapitre men shall now see many other faire matters , which were to longe for to be reherced in the preamble of this present booke .<newpage pageno="16"/> Truelye we finde in the gestes ＆ faites of the good kynge Charlemagne / that vpo*n* a time at a feast of Penthecoste , the sayde kyng Charlemagne kept a ryght great and solempne court at Parys , after that he was come againe fro the partyes of Lombardy / where he had had a ryght great and mervaylous batayle agenst the Sarasyns ,<footnote fntext="et mescreans, F. orig. b. i."/> and suche folke as were oute of the beleve , wherof the cheef of the sayde Sarasins was named Guithelym the sesne . The whiche the said kynge Charlemagne / by hys prowesse and valyauntnes / had dyscomfyted ＆ overcomen . At the which battaylle and dyscomfyture , dyed greate noblenesses of kinges , princes , Dukes , Erles , barons , knyghtes , and squyers ; as Salomon of bretayne / Huon , erle of Mauns , syr yves , syr yvoyre berenger , and Haton , syr Arnaulde of Beaulande , syr Walleraunte of Bollon , and many valyaunte knyghtes . The Douse peres of Fraunce were come there / and many Almaynes , and Englyshemenne , Normans , Poeteuyns , Lombardes , and Barnyers .

Than at this assemble and feast stood the sayd kynge Charlemagne on his feete , amonge his prynces and barons , sayinge in this wyse , ' barons , my bretherne and freendes , ye knowe howe I have conquested and gotten so manye greate londes / by youre helpe and succours . So many of the Sarasins and misbelevers brought to<newpage pageno="17"/> death , ＆ in my subieccion ; how but late agoe ye have seene by ye paynym Guetelym , whiche I have dyscomfyted ＆ overcomen / and reduced to the christen faith . Not withstandynge we have loste there ryghte greate chevalry and noblenesse , and for faute of many of our vassaylles / and subjectes . that to vs dayneth not to come , howe be it that we had sent for theym , as the Duke Rycharde of Roussellon , the duke Dron of Nantuell / and the duke Benes of Aygremounte , that been all three bretherne Germayne . Wherof vnto you I complayne me and tell you , that yf it were not syr Salamon , that worthylye came to succoure vs / with .xxx. thousande fyghtynge menne , and syr Lambreyght bernyer , and syr Geffraye of Bourdelle , with walleraunte of Bullon , that bare our baner / we were alle dyscomfyted and lost , as ye all knowe well ; and this by the defaut of the said three bretherene , that dayned never to come to our sendynge , nor obey , and , above all , the duke Benes of Aygremounte . Ill be it that they be all oure lyege menne / that ever owen to me servyce and fydelytie . Now I shall sende hym worde that he come to serve me at this nexte somer with all his power . And in case that he shall be refusynge to obeye oure commaundementes / by saynt denys of fraunce , I shall sende for all my freendes and subjectes , and I shall goe besyege him at Aygremounte . And yf we can have him , I shall make hym to be shamefully hanged / and his sonne Mawgis to be slaine all quycke , and shall do brenne his vncourteous wyfe ; and I shall sett all his londes in fyre . ' Than the good duke Naymes of Bavyere / rose vp dyligently , and said to kynge Charlemagne in this wyse : ' Syr , me semeth that ye ought not to angre your selfe so sore ; and yf ye will beleve my counseyll , ye shal sende a messanger to the duke of Aygremount , which messanger shal be well and honourably accompanied .
