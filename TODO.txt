✅︎ change 'ortho' tag to 'so' = standardised orthography
✅︎ parsing - replace <phr> tag with (e.g.) <vp>, <np>, <cp>
✅︎ spelling - allow spelling rules to be defined in a file, then reference that file in the function parameters
lemmatisation - maybe using a file of common spelling variants and morphology
✅︎ move all tags such as <newpage>, <newfolio> at doc head into the first sentence, so the only children of <document> are <s> tags
count frequency of a given set of words (e.g. count all examples of you, yow, geow etc)
combine multiple documents into a corpus
